# 3DCDataset
Dataset used in many works by Ulysse Côté-Allard et al.. All credit goes to the authors for the collection of this dataset. This repo just was created for ease of cloning the dataset. The dataset was originally collected in study [1], and subsequently used in study [2]. All studies that make use of this dataset should properly credit [1].
